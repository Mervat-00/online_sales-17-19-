it is a SQL data analysis project, the data is about a company's sales from 2017 to 2019, they have had to cut back from 25 employees to 5 because of the economic downturn, I tried to help them out with some informative SQL analysis to find out the weak points they have.
The data came in a data base contained all the sales data from 2017 to 2019 and monthly details , I transferred the data needed for the analysis to CSV files, using bulk copy program (BCP) after running some exploratory and preparing the data for the reporting stage some SQL grouping and filtering functions ,creating views ,CTEs ,and complicated sub-queries.
