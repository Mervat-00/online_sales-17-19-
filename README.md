it is a SQL data analysis project, the data is about a company's sales from 2017 to 2019, they have had to cut back from 25 employees to 5 because of the economic downturn with the coronavirus , I tried to help them out with some informative SQL analysis to find out the weak points they have.

you can find the data on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylermorse/retail-business-sales-20172019)
